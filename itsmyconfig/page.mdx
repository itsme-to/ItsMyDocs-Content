## Introduction {{ anchor: false }}

The basic principle of ItsMyConfig is to add support for MiniMessage, PlaceholderAPI, and Custom Tags to any message from any addon as long as it is configurable. All you need is for the message to start with the `symbol-prefix` you have defined in the `config.yml` (defaults to the `$` symbol). 
If a message starts with this symbol, ItsMyConfig can detect it and add support for everything.
