## 2. Create the Bot on Discord
When the installation is complete and after running the bot once to generate the config files, you’ll need to create the bot application on Discord.
1. Go to the [Discord developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) site.
2. Create a new application.
3. Go to the **Installation** tab.
4. Set the **Installation Link** to **None**
5. Go to the **Bot** tab.
6. Disable the **Public Bot** option.
7. Enable the **Presence Intent**, **Server Members Intent**, and **Message Content Intent** options.
8. Go to the **OAuth2** tab.
9. In the **OAuth2 URL Generator** section, check the **bot** and **applications.commands** scopes.
10. In the **Bot Permissions** section, check the **Administrator** permission.
11. Copy the generated link at the bottom of the page, paste it into your browser, and add the bot to your server.

## 3. Configuring the Bot
1. Return to the [Discord developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) site.
2. Choose your application and go to the **Bot** tab.
3. Reset the bot token to get a new token.
4. Copy the token.
5. Open the `/configs/config.yml` file.
6. Paste the token into the `token` field.
7. Add your primary guild ID to the `primary-guild` field. The primary guild is the guild where the bot will be primarily used. To find your guild ID, you can right-click on the server name in Discord and select **Copy Server ID**. *Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in your Discord settings*.
8. Save the file.
9. If you have addons for the bot, you can add them to the `/build/addons/` folder. The folders need to be unzipped, with each addon in its own folder.
10. Launch the bot and enjoy the features of ItsMyBot!

To understand how the bot works, you can refer to the other pages of the documentation.
