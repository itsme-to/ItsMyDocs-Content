# Embeds Plugins
Embeds is a simple plugin that allows you to create embeds and messages with a YAML configuration file.

</div>

## Create an Embed

Create a new file in the `configs/Embeds/embeds` folder or one of its subfolders. This file will contain the configuration for your message, including the content, embeds, and components.
For the syntax of the configuration file, see the [Message configuration](/itsmybot/configuration/message) page.

## Update an Embed
To make an embed updatable, you need to add the `update-time` property to the embed configuration. The value of this property is the time in minutes after which the embed will be updated. The embed will be updated with the new content in the configuration and update all the placeholders.

## Example
```yaml
content: "Hello %user_mention% !"
update-time: 5
embeds:
  - title: "%mcstatus_example_players% Players"
    description: "Server is %mcstatus_example_status% !"
    color: "#ff0000"
```
