# What is Scripting in ItsMyBot?

Scripting in ItsMyBot allows you to create custom scripts that can automate tasks, respond to events, and extend the bot's functionalities. Scripts are written in YAML format and can include actions, triggers, conditions, and mutators.

You can even access the official ItsMyBot script library, full of free scripts to improve your bot. If you’ve created a script and want to share it, join the Discord and mention me!

# Configuring an Action / Script

The configuration of an action is done in the `actions` section of the script. Each action has its own set of arguments, triggers, conditions, and mutators. The action is executed when the trigger is fired and the conditions are met.

You can have actions in scripts, custom commands, and more.

## Example Action Config
```yaml
actions:
  - id: sendMessage
    args:
      components:
        - type: text-display
          content: "Hello there !"
      chance: 0.25 # 25% chance to send the message
    triggers: everyHour
    mutators:
      channel: "935421560355946596" # Channel ID or name
    conditions:
      - id: memberCountAbove
        args:
          amount: 100 # Number of members in the server
```
The above example will send a message "Hello there !" every hour in the channel with ID `935421560355946596` if the server has more than 100 members. The message will only be sent with a 25% chance.

## Understanding the Sections

<Properties>
  <Property name="id">
    The id of the action. You can find the list of all actions [here](/itsmybot/scripting/actions).
  </Property>
  <Property name="args">
    The arguments of the action. Each action has its own set of arguments. There are also some common arguments that can be used in all actions. You can find the list of all default arguments [here](#optional-arguments).
  </Property>
  <Property name="triggers">
    The list of triggers that will trigger the action. You can find the list of all triggers [here](/itsmybot/scripting/triggers). The action is executed when the trigger is fired.
  </Property>
  <Property name="conditions">
    The list of conditions that must be met for the action to be executed. You can find the list of all conditions [here](/itsmybot/scripting/conditions). The action is executed only if the conditions is met.
  </Property>
  <Property name="mutators">
    The list of mutators that will be applied to the action. You can find the list of all mutators [here](/itsmybot/scripting/mutators). The mutators are applied to the action to edit the context of the action.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Optional Arguments
Some actions have optional arguments that can be used to modify the behavior of the action. These arguments are not required, but can be useful in certain situations.
<Properties>
  <Property name="delay">
    The delay in seconds before the action is executed. This can be used to delay the action for a certain amount of time. Default is 0 (no delay).
  </Property>
  <Property name="chance">
    The chance of the action being executed. This can be used to execute the action with a certain probability. Default is 1 (100%).
  </Property>
  <Property name="cooldown">
    The cooldown in seconds before the action can be executed again. This can be used to prevent the action from being executed too frequently.
  </Property>
  <Property name="every">
    Specify the action to activate every X time. This can be used to execute the action every X time.
  </Property>
  <Property name="follow-up-actions">
    Specific to only some actions. The actions inside will be triggered by the actions. Example: `sendMessage` action can trigger the `deleteMessage` action.
    ```yaml
    actions:
      - id: sendMessage
        triggers: messageCreate
        args:
          components:
            - type: text-display
              content: "Hello there !"
          follow-up-actions:
            - id: deleteMessage
              args:
                delay: 5
    ```
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Action Chain
You can chain multiple actions together by using the `actions` property. This allows you to execute multiple actions in a single script. The actions are executed in the order they are defined.
With the action chain, multiple actions can be impacted by the same trigger. With the mutators & conditions that apply to all actions in the chain.
```yaml
actions:
  - triggers: messageCreate
    actions:
      - id: reply
        args:
          components:
            - type: text-display
              content: "This is a reply to your message."
      - id: addReaction
        args:
          value: "✅"
    conditions:
      - id: inChannel
        args:
          value: "935421560355946596" # Channel ID or name
```
