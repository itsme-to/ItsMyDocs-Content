# Create Custom Commands
With ItsMyBot and the [scripting](/itsmybot/scripting/) system, you can create custom commands to extend the bot's functionalities. These commands can be used to perform various actions, such as sending messages, managing roles, and more.

Each custom command need to be created in the `scripting/custom-commands` folder in the bot's directory. It supports subfolders, so you can organize your commands as you want. Each command is a .yml file that contains the command's configuration. You can disable a command by adding an underscore at the beginning of the file name, for example: `_my-command.yml`.

## Command Structure
A custom command is a YAML file that contains the following structure:
<CodeGroup>
```yaml {{ title: 'Usage' }}
name: #string, the name of the command, used to call it in Discord.
description: #string, the description of the command, used to display it in the help command.
options: #list, the list of options for the command.
actions: #list, the list of actions to perform when the command is executed.
```
```yaml {{ title: 'Example' }}
name: give-role
description: "Give a role to a user."
options:
  - name: user # Option name
    type: "user" # Option type
    description: "The user to give the role to"
    required: true # Option required
  - name: role
    type: "role"
    description: "Select a role to add to the user"
    required: true
actions:
  - actions:
    - id: addRole
      args:
        value: "%option_role_id%"
    - id: reply
      args:
        delay: 3
        components: 
          - type: text-display
            content: "Role %option_role_mention% added to %option_user_mention%"
    mutators:
      member: "%option_user_id%" # Transform the main member to the user selected in the option.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Options types
Options are the parameters that can be passed to a command when it is executed. They can be used to customize the behavior of the command. Each option has a type, a name, a description, and can have additional properties depending on its type.

### `string` 
A string option is a text input that can be used to provide a value for the command.
- Add the placeholder `%option_<option-name>%` to use the value of the option in the actions.
<CodeGroup>
```yaml {{ title: 'Usage' }}
type: string
description: #string, the description of the option.
required: #boolean, if the option is required or not.
choices: #list, the list of choices for the option. Each choice is a dictionary with the following keys:
  - name: #string, the name of the choice.
    value: #string, the value of the choice.
max-length: #integer, the maximum length of the option value. Only used for `string` type.
min-length: #integer, the minimum length of the option value. Only used for `string` type.
```
```yaml {{ title: 'Example' }}
name: my-command
description: This is a custom command.

```
</CodeGroup>

### `integer`/`number`
An integer option is a numeric input that can be used to provide a value for the command.
