# Configure with ItsMyBot
Configuring ItsMyBot might seem intimidating if you don’t have much experience with configuration. In this documentation, I will do my best to explain all the different parts you can use to make ItsMyBot fit exactly what you need.

I created ItsMyBot with the goal of making it as complete and configurable as possible, which, as a result, makes it a bit more complex. But I’m here to help you use it! You can always send a message in the ItsMyBot support channel on [Discord](https://itsmy.studio/discord) to ask your questions. I’ll be happy to assist you and listen to your feedback to improve the documentation!
