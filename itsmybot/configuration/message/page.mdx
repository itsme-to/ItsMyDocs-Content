# How to configure Message
In this guide, you will learn how to configure a message and everything you can do with it. Discord recently released a new format for bots called **ComponentV2**. This guide will explain how to create messages using this format. If you want to use the old format, you can refer to the [Old Format Message](/itsmybot/configuration/message-old) page. 

Messages support [placeholders](/itsmybot/configuration/placeholders/), you can put them in any part of the message, and they will be replaced with the corresponding value when the message is sent.

To make things easier for you, I have implemented the format on discord.builders, allowing you to create your messages with a convenient interface and directly generate the configuration!

# Message Configuration
This is the main part of the message configuration. You set everything you want to display in the message here. The message is composed of components, which are the building blocks of the message. Each component has a type and can have various options.

- Support the following components: [`text-display`](#text-display), [`container`](#container), [`section`](#section), [`action-row`](#action-row), [`media-gallery`](#media-gallery), [`separator`](#separator), [`file`](#file) & [`repeat`](#repeat).
<CodeGroup>
```yaml {{ title: 'Usage' }}
ephemeral: #boolean, optional, if true the bot will send the message as an ephemeral message. Only works for messages from an interaction.
disable-mentions: #boolean, optional, if true the bot will not mention rolses or users in the message.
components: # list of components, the components of the message
```

```yaml {{ title: 'Example' }}
ephemeral: true # Optional, if true the bot will send the message as an ephemeral message. Only works for messages from an interaction.
components: # The components of the message. With the new format, all the content of the message is in the components.
  - type: "text-display" # A text display component, it will display the content as a text.
    content: "Hello there !"
  - type: "container" # A container component. It's a bit like an embed, but with more flexibility.
    components:
      - type: 'section' # A section component, it's a text display list with an accessory. 
        components:
          - type: 'text-display'
            content: "This is a section with a text display."
          - type: 'text-display'
            content: "You can add multiple components in a section."
        accessory: # The accessory of the section, it can be a button or an image.
          type: 'button'
          label: 'Click me !'
          style: 'url'
          url: 'https://itsmy.studio/discord'
      - type: 'separator' # A separator component, it will add a separator between the components.
      - type: 'action-row' # An action row component, it's used to have a row of components. Buttons or one select menu.
        components:
          - type: 'button'

# Components
As explained above, with Discord’s new format, all the content is now done through components. Below, you will find a list of all the possible components you can include in your message. There are no components that are required in a message.

### Component Conditions
Each component supports conditions, these are exactly the same conditions you can find in scripts. They allow you to display a component only in certain cases, so your message can adapt to the context.
You can find the list of available [conditions here](/itsmybot/scripting/conditions/). The format is as follows:
<CodeGroup>
```yaml {{ title: 'Usage' }}
components:
  - type: <component-type> # The type of the component
    conditions: # Optional, the conditions of the component
      - id: <condition-id> # The id of the condition
        args: # The arguments of the condition
          <arg-name>: <arg-value> # The arguments of the condition
```

```yaml {{ title: 'Example' }}
components:
  - type: "text-display"
    content: "Hello there !"
    conditions:
      - id: aboveMembers
        args:
          amount: 10
```
</CodeGroup>

      - "Hi !"
      - "Greetings !"
  - type: text-display
    content: | # A multiline text display with markdown formatting
